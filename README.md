# Flight Delay Predictor ✈️
A web-based application that predicts the likelihood of flight delays using machine learning. This project combines data preprocessing, model training, and a React-based frontend to provide users with real-time delay predictions for flights.
## 🚀 Features

Predicts whether a flight will be on time or delayed.
User-friendly React + TypeScript frontend.
Machine learning model built with Python (Scikit-learn / TensorFlow depending on your implementation).
REST API backend for handling predictions.
Clean UI for entering flight details like origin, destination, airline, departure time, etc.
Scalable architecture (Frontend + Backend separation).

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend
React (TypeScript)
Vite (Bundler)
Tailwind CSS (Styling)

Backend
Node.js / Express (for API routes)
Python (for ML model)
Flask / FastAPI (optional if integrated directly with Python backend)

Machine Learning
Pandas, NumPy (data preprocessing)
Scikit-learn (model training)
Pickle/Joblib (model persistence)

⚙️ Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Anshu-raj-co/Flight-Delay-Predictor.git
cd Flight-Delay-Predictor

2️⃣ Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev

Frontend will start on http://localhost:5173/

3️⃣ Run the backend
cd backend
npm install
npm start

Backend will run on http://localhost:5000/

4️⃣ Machine Learning Model (optional if retraining)
cd model
python train.py

This generates model.pkl used by the backend.

🎯 How It Works
User enters flight details in the frontend.
Frontend sends the request to backend API.
Backend loads the trained ML model.
Model predicts whether the flight will be delayed.
Result is displayed to the user.

📊 Dataset
The model is trained on publicly available flight datasets (e.g., US Flight Delay Dataset
 or Kaggle datasets).

💡 Future Improvements
Deploy on Vercel/Netlify (frontend) and Heroku/Render/AWS (backend).
Add data visualization dashboards.
Enhance model accuracy with deep learning models.
Add user authentication for saving predictions.
Implement CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment.
